## Questions

### Delete Questions

As questions are used within sessions and the answers and evaluation graphs link to a specific question, _deleting a question is not possible_. In future, it will be possible to archive questions. Thus, the question is not deleted entirely but not visible within the question pool anymore.

### Edit Questions

As questions are used within sessions and the answers and evaluation graphs link to a specific question, _editing a question is only partially possible_. The question title and the tags are only used for organization. Therfore, it is possible to change the title and tags at any time. To change the question asked to the audience and the possible answers or input restrictions a new version needs to be created.
