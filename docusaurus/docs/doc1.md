The Klicker UZH is a web application thought to support the interaction between speakers and their audience and does so in various ways. During a Klicker session (e.g., a lecture), a speaker may pose questions to be answered by participants over their computer or mobile devices. Additionally, students may rate the speed and difficulty of the session and provide open feedback, if so desired by the speaker. Next to the well-known speaker-to-audience interaction, this also enables interactions initiated by the audience, which can serve as a useful orientation to the lecturer.

The Klicker UZH was originally developed by the Department of Banking and Finance at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. It has been in heavy use for many years (both in- and outside of our University), and the foundations have gotten outdated over the course of these years. The upcoming relaunch of our Klicker tool is thought to build on a more state-of-the-art foundation and adds many highly requested features and functionalities. Furthermore, the development and code of our new tool are entirely open-source, allowing for further extensibility.

This documentation shortly introduces our Klicker tool and provides a step-by-step guide about its suggested usage. It will later be extended by more detailed documentation about the API and open-source related information.
