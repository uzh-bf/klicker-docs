title: Edit a Question
---

On the [Question Pool](doc5.md) screen, click the _Edit_ button next to the question to edit it.

As questions are used in sessions and may be evaluated, not every part of a question may be edited. To edit the question posed to the audience and the available choices for input restrictions for the answer, a new version of the question needs to be created. The following list shows how to edit a question and how create a new version of a question:

1. **Question Type:** Once a question is created the question type can not be changed.

2. **Question Title:** The question title may be changed at any time and stays the same for all versions of a question.

3. **Tags:** Like the question title, the tags may be edited at any time. All versions of a question have the same tags.

4. **Question Versions:** To change the actual question (5) and the available choices (SC/MC) or input restrictions (NR) a new version needs to be created. Click the _New Version_ tab to create a new version.

5. **Question:** The question posed to the audience may be edited in a new version of the question.

6. **Available Choices (SC / MC only):** The available choices may be edited like creating a question.

7. **Save:** Press the _Save_ button to save the edited question or the new created version.
