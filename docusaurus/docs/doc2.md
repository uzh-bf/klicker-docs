Before a speech takes place, the speaker creates questions and groups them within a session.
A session is the main tool of Klicker and consists of multiple blocks of at least one
question. During the speech (ongoing session), the speaker unlocks the question blocks so
that the audience can answer the questions within this block. The evaluation of the
questions may be viewed instantly and if desired shared with the audience.

While the speaker is having his cockpit to manage the session, question blocks, and feedback
settings, the audience may participate over mobile phones, laptops, and tablets.

Follow this documentation chapter for chapter to get guided through a typical Klicker workflow including the following steps:

- creating different types of questions
- creating a session with question blocks and questions
- executing a session and let the audience answer the prepared questions
- evaluating the answered questions
