title: The Klicker-Workflow
---

In the Klicker UZH, sessions are the foundational concept on which all of the other functionality is built. A single Klicker session corresponds to a single event during which the Klicker is planned to be used (e.g., a 1.5h lecture block). Klicker sessions are structured such that they can be started at the beginning of an event and closed after its completion (decoupled from the actual timing of questions posed).

During an active Klicker session, the speaker can pose the questions that have been assigned to the respective session. The speaker can further enable the optional audience-to-speaker interactions, allowing the audience to rate the speed and difficulty of the session as well as to give the speaker open-form feedback.

In preparation for a Klicker session, a speaker can create questions of different types and subsequently assigns the questions to a new session, wherein the questions can further be grouped into blocks of questions. A question block simply signifies a group of questions that are shown to the audience in a sequence and also evaluated as such (as a "block"). A session may contain an arbitrary sequence of said question blocks, to each of which at least one question must be assigned.

During the execution of a session, the question blocks defined for the respective session are then activated and evaluated in the predefined order. Activating a question block presents the questions to the audience and enables the evaluation screen, on which the results may be observed in near real-time.

The flow of a session is controlled on and by the speaker's "Running Session" screen, which is thought to be entirely separate from the evaluation screen. While the evaluation screen can and should be presented to the audience (e.g., on a projector), the "Running Session" screen corresponds to the speaker's "cockpit" and contains information and settings restricted to the speaker.

The remainder of this documentation is structured as a "step-by-step" guide through a typical Klicker-Workflow, including the following steps:

- Creation of different types of questions
- Creation of a session including question blocks and questions
- Execution of a session
- Evaluation of the questions as posed in the session
